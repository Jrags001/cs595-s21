Assignment 1 Documentation

Instructions: Set up and run a server on your local machine.
Install three "paths" on your server, with each path corresponding to a favorite artist, musician, film, or TV series.

1.	After getting everything set up on my local machine, I proceeded to create a local host server on the machine that would be called using the command http-server. 
2.	From then on, I proceeded to code all the html for the three respective choices I made. 
3.	For the favicon image I simply pulled an image from the internet and created a file with it on the GitHub website and pulled it to my local repository on my pc. 
4.	From then on, I altered the code on the html file so it would point to the respective image inside the Griffin\1 folder. After confirming that all the wording was correct I launched my server. 
5.	This is where I saw that the local server and code along with the favicon image was working as intended. 
6.	I used an app called Streamlabs OBS to record the video then I proceeded to upload it onto my YouTube channel.
