To start the assignment, I create the directory for the class and for this
assignment on my Desktop. Then, I used the "touch" command to create the 
javascript file, the 3 html files, and the README.md file. Then, I used "nano"
to edit into the files and write the code for the javascript file and the 
html files. I, then, used "node" to run the javascript file. I used
quicktimeplayer to screenrecord me viewing the files, running the node
command, and opening the html files in safari.
